    Write the constructor for the WordDuoList class.  The constructor
    takes an array of Strings as a parameter and initializes the
    instance variable allDuos to an ArrayList of WordDuo objects.

    A WordDuo object consists of a word from the array paired with a
    word that appears later in the array.  The allDuos list constins
    WordDuo objects (words[i], words[j]) for every i and j, where
    0<=i<j<words.length.  Each WordDuo object is added exactly once to
    the list.

    The following examples illustrate two different WordDuo objects.

    Example 1:
    String [] wordNums = {"one", "two", "three"};
    WordDuoList exampleOne = new WordDuoList(wordNums);

    After the code has executed, the allDuos instance variable
    of exampleOne will contain the following WordDuo objects in the
    same order.
    ("one", "two"), ("one", "three"), ("two", "three")

    Example 2:
    String[] phrase = {"the", "more", "the", "merrier"};
    WordDuoList exampleTwo = new WordDuoList(phrase);

    After the code segment has executed, the allDuos instance variable of
    exampleTwo will contain the following WordDuo objects in come order.
    ("the", "more"), ("the", "the"), ("the", "merrier"),
    ("more", "the"), ("more", "merrier"), ("the", "merrier")
